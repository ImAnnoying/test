<p> element selectors - name of the tag</p>
    <p>class selectors - tags with the same class="cock" are ruled by the power of .cock</p>
    <p>id's - #lol</p>
<p>you can group them with , so they don't feel so fcking lonely</p>
    <p>you can also specify for a certain CSS rule to only apply to one type of element, even if it's in a class. p.big{font-size: 500px;}</p>
    <p>children slavery: <b>article > p{ebola};</b> basically allows you to use styling applied only to an element in a certain context; in this case, paragraphs that are nested directly inside an &lt;article&gt; tag</p>
    <p>you can make indirect child slaves with <b>article p{ebola};</b></p>
    <p>you can apply multiple classes to an element by using *space* to list them</p>
    <p>also applying a rule to elements having both classes by .class1.class2</p>
    <p>more complex children:</p>
    <div><img src="children.PNG" width="600" alt="child labour" title="child labour"></div>
    <p>if it's a class or id or whatever instead of an element, it means it will affect an element bearing that marking</p>
